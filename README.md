Kumpenot’s highest priority is securing our clients’ funds and personal information. To that end, we have an exceptional security technology infrastructure with login guard, cold storage, and the highest data encryption standards available. We also ensure complete legal compliance to protect our clients and exchange via robust AML and KYC policies, FinCen registration, and PCI DSS certification. 



Kumpenot was launched in 2018 following a year of development by unabashed Bitcoin nerds with elite knowledge of blockchain technology. Our mission is to apply our development skill, ingenuity, and deep knowledge of cryptos to improving upon the functionality and accessibility of existing digital asset exchanges. We are committed to making cryptocurrency available to more people because we believe in the potential that it represents to positively transform global commerce.

Kumpenot has quickly become one of the preferred cryptocurrency exchanges for buying, selling, and securely storing Bitcoins. We feature a secure offline wallet, and a Bitcoin debit card that makes purchasing goods and services with Bitcoin quick and easy. Our team is passionate about making a unique contribution to the blockchain revolution.
